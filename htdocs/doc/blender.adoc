== Introduction

http://www.blender.org/[Blender] is a magnificent free open-source modeling software.

You can use Blender to create 3D and 2D models, with animations, and export them to glTF.

== Exporting to glTF

Exporting from Blender to link:gltf[glTF 2.0] is the best way to use _Blender_ with _Castle Game Engine_.

* Export using the _File -> Export -> glTF 2.0_ menu item in Blender.

* Load the resulting file (in `.glb` or `.gltf` formats) to cgeref:TCastleScene[]. See manual about link:viewport_and_scenes[viewports and scenes].

* You can also open the glTF file with link:view3dscene.php[view3dscene].

=== Important links

* link:https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html[Blender documentation of the glTF exporter] documents how to setup your models in Blender to export correctly to glTF.

// Too much info?
//* The exporter is link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO[developed by Khronos on GitHub].

* link:creating_data_model_formats.php#section_gltf[Details about Castle Game Engine support for glTF]. We support most glTF features, including physical materials and skinned animation.

=== Advised glTF export settings

* You usually want to check _"Geometry -> Apply Modifiers"_ in the export dialog.
* _"Remember Export Settings"_ is also usually useful.
* For typical games (where you distribute the game data with your application) we recommend exporting to _"glTF Separate (.gltf + .bin + textures)"_ variant. This allows to share textures between various models and keeps importing fast. You can edit the _"Textures"_ directory in the export dialog, to make the glTF file just point to your existing texture directory.

== Advanced topics

=== Stashing animations

You may want to _Stash_ animations to have them reliably exported, as is briefly mentioned by link:https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html[exporter docs]. That is:

* go to _"Animation"_ view (or turn any Blender window into _"Dope Sheet"_)
* select _Armature_ (e.g. by left-clicking in 3D view)
* change _"Dope Sheet"_ mode to _"Action Editor"_
* select each animation (aka "action" in Blender) you want (repeat this for all animations you want to export)
* click _"Stash"_

=== Custom properties

cgeimg::float[blender_castle_collision_prop.png|Setting CastleCollision property in Blender]

Blender can export _Custom properties_ from various objects to glTF, and our engine reads them. You can access them by cgeref:TAbstractNode.MetadataString[MetadataString] and similar properties on X3D nodes. Demos:

* See link:https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models[our demo-models], subdirectories `blender/custom_properties/` and `blender/custom_properties_2/`, for sample models.

* See https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/blob/master/examples/short_api_samples/metadata/metadata_use.dpr[examples/short_api_samples/metadata/metadata_use.dpr] for sample Pascal code getting/setting metadata from Pascal.

Usage of custom properties:

* Custom properties on Blender materials are imported as metadata on X3D material nodes, like cgeref:TPhysicalMaterialNode[].
+
For example access them like:
+
[source,pascal]
----
MyString := MyMaterial.MetadataString['material_property_name'];
----

* Custom properties on Blender cameras are imported as metadata on X3D viewpoint nodes, like cgeref:TViewpointNode[].

* Custom properties on Blender meshes are imported as metadata on the _immediate parent `Group` of each X3D `Shape` node_. Note that many X3D shapes may be part of one Blender mesh.
+
For example, if you have a cgeref:TShapeNode[] instance, you can look at parent group by cgeref:TX3DNode.ParentFieldsNode[] property. To read metadata from the corresponding Blender mesh do this:
+
[source,pascal]
----
if MyShape.ParentFieldsCount = 1 then
  MyString := MyShape.ParentFieldsNode[0].MetadataString['mesh_property_name']
else
  WritelnWarning('Shape not created by glTF importer');
----

* Custom properties on Blender objects are imported as metadata on the _immediate parent `Transform` of each X3D `Group` representing Blender mesh_. Note that one Blender mesh may be part of multiple Blender objects.

=== Controlling if the shape is collidable in Castle Game Engine

We recognize a special property `CastleCollision` at Blender mesh. It sets link:x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shape_collision[X3DShapeNode.collision] field in X3D (cgeref:TAbstractShapeNode.Collision[] in Pascal API). It accepts the following values:

* `none` &mdash; non-collidable mesh.
* `box` &mdash; mesh collides as a simple axis-aligned box (auto-calculated from bounding box of the shape, unless link:x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shape_bbox[Shape.Bbox] is explicitly specified).
* `default` &mdash; mesh collides as a precise set of triangles.
