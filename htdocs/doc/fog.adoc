_Fog_ can be added and configured using the cgeref:TCastleFog[] component. The component is available in CGE editor, so you add and configure your fog even without writing any code.

The usage is simple:

1. Add a fog component anywhere to the design using _"Add Non-Visual Component -> Fog (TCastleFog)"_ in editor.

2. Set the fog as active for given viewport by adjusting the cgeref:TCastleViewport.Fog[] property.

3. Adjust the fog parameters, like cgeref:TCastleFog.Color[] and cgeref:TCastleFog.VisibilityRange[].

4. Optionally, also adjust the background color to match the fog color. The fog looks most natural in this case.
+
For example adjust the cgeref:TCastleViewport.BackgroundColor[] and leave cgeref:TCastleViewport.Background[] empty (`nil`) for a simple background color.
+
See link:background[more about backgrounds].

NOTE: The fog is aplied in the final (sRGB) color space, this allows to match fog color perfectly to background color or UI easily. This means that link:color_space[Linear color space (gamma correction)] doesn't affect fog application.
