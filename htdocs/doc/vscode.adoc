:description: Using Visual Studio Code with intelligent code completion for Pascal and Castle Game Engine API.
:cge-social-share-image: vscode_completion.png

== Introduction

https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] is a powerful, free and open-source, cross-platform text editor for programmers.

Below we describe how to configure it to be a perfect code editor for Pascal, and in particular for your _Castle Game Engine_ projects. We're proud to provide an LSP server that will make VS Code do _intelligent code completion_ that works great with Pascal and automatically completes all _Castle Game Engine_ API.

== Make Castle Game Engine invoke VS Code

Go to _Castle Game Engine_ editor preferences, _"Code Editor"_ tab, and select the _"Visual Studio Code"_.

cgeimg::block[vscode_preferences.png|Configure VS Code in CGE Preferences]

This will make CGE automatically open _VS Code_ when you open Pascal file

- by double-clicking Pascal unit from CGE editor _"Files"_ panel,
- by double-clicking a message in the _"Output"_ window referencing some Pascal file,
- using menu item _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_,
- and in all other cases when CGE wants to open Pascal file.

== Pascal syntax highlighting

There are multiple _VS Code_ extensions that provide Pascal code highlighting.

We recommend https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AnsonYeung.pascal-language-basics[Pascal Language Basics]. It's available in the _VS Code_ marketplace, so you can just search for it and install right inside the VS Code _"Extensions"_ panel.

== Pascal code completion

We provide an _LSP server_ that implements an _intelligent code completion_ for Pascal and is aware of _Castle Game Engine_ units and default syntax options (e.g. FPC _ObjFpc_ mode).

NOTE: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[Our LSP server] is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander\'s LSP server] which in turn relies on https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] _CodeTools_ to do the code completion. So inside there is really a lot of work and testing from many people in the Pascal ecosystem to make it powerful.

To use it with VS Code:

1. Install the https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode[Pascal Language Server Extension for Visual Studio Code]. It's easiest to do this by:
+
--
- Downloading https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode/raw/master/pascal-language-server-0.0.1.vsix[this VSIX file].
- Use _"Install from VSIX..."_ menu item in VS Code to install it:
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_install_vsix.png|Install from VSIX]
- Once done, you will see _"Pascal Language Server"_ extension installed. Make sure it is enabled.
--

2. Configure the extension, pointing it to your FPC, Lazarus, and `pasls` (our LSP server).
+
cgeimg::block[vscode_extension_config.png|VS Code Extension configuration]
+
--
- Open the extension settings.
- Set `Env: FPCDIR` to point to the FPC source code. If you use FPC bundled with CGE, this should look like `<cgepath>/tools/contrib/fpc/src/`.
- Set `Env: FPCTARGET` to your OS, like `linux` or `windows`.
- Set `Env: FPCTARGETCPU` to your CPU, like `x86_64`.
- Set `Env: LAZARUSDIR` to your Lazarus (source) directory. This is optional, fill it if you have https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] installed. It will enable to find LCL units and do the code completion for LCL components too.
- Set `Env: PP` to your FPC executable. If you use FPC bundled with CGE, this should look like `<cgepath>/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge`. Add `.exe` extension on Windows. If you use regular FPC, this is a path to your regular FPC executable (`fpc`, `fpc.exe`, `fpc.sh`).
- Finally, set `Executable` to point to our LSP server, inside CGE `bin` subdirectory. This should look like `<cgepath>/bin/pasls`. Add `.exe` extension on Windows.

3. Enjoy!
+
--
- Open any _Castle Game Engine_ project.
- You can open it from _Castle Game Engine_ editor (e.g. by _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item).
- Or you can open it from VS Code, using _"File -> Open Folder"_.
- Place your cursor somewhere, hit _Ctrl + Space_ and enjoy a proper code completion.
+

- Right click on any Pascal item and use _"Go To Definition"_, _"Go To Declaration"_ or just _Ctrl + click_ on it to move around. You can also peek at definition and declaration using _"Peek -> ..."_.

NOTE: There are more VS Code extension settings, but most of them are not handled (and not necessary) for our LSP server, they are only handled by the alternative https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server[Ryan Joseph\'s Pascal LSP server].

[NOTE]
====
If you have installed FPC yourself using link:fpcupdeluxe[] on Unix, remember to point `Env: PP` to the `fpc.sh` script (and not to the `fpc` binary) that should always be used to execute FPC managed by `fpcupdeluxe` on Unix.

In general, the `Env: PP` executable may be run by CodeTools, which may assume this FPC version "knows" standard RTL paths. That's why it's important to pass `fpc.sh` (in case of fpcupdeluxe) or `fpc-cge` (in case of FPC bundled with CGE) and not the "bare" `fpc` executable.
====

== Running and debugging

It is easiest to just run from _Castle Game Engine_ editor using F9 (_"Run -> Compile And Run_").

If you really want to run and debug from _VS Code_:

- CGE applications compiled in _debug_ mode contain debug symbols compatible with GDB. Any debugger extension in _VS Code_ based on GDB should work.

- To build and run CGE applications without leaving VS Code, you can utilize our command-line link:build_tool[build tool].
+
--
- Set `CASTLE_ENGINE_PATH` environment variable to point to your CGE directory.
- Extend the `PATH` environment variable to contain the `bin` subdirectory of your CGE directory.
- Make sure that FPC is also on `PATH`, so that our build tool can find it.
- Configure the _VS Code_ tasks to build using `castle-engine compile --mode=debug` and run using `castle-engine run`. Remember to restart all applications (like VS Code) that need to be aware of new environment variables' values.

== More Information and Credits

- The LSP server we use is based on https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server[Philip Zander\'s Pascal LSP server].

- Our fork of the LSP server is here: https://github.com/castle-engine/pascal-language-server[LSP server for Pascal and Castle Game Engine].

- https://github.com/genericptr/pasls-vscode[VS Code extension] is developed by _Ryan Joseph_.

- There is an alternative https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server[Ryan Joseph\'s Pascal LSP server]. We have https://github.com/michaliskambi/pascal-language-server-genericptr[forked it too] to add some CGE extensions, though ultimately we decided to not focus on it.

- Both LSP servers are based on initial work of _Arjan Adriaanse_. They both use latest https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus] CodeTools to do the actual code completion, so we can enjoy in every editor the same power as Lazarus users.

== Other text editors

The LSP server is fully useful with any text editor that supports LSP, not only _VS Code_.

=== Emacs

You can use it with https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs]. See https://github.com/michaliskambi/elisp/tree/master/lsp[Michalis Kamburelis notes about LSP + Pascal + CGE + Emacs].

The short version is:

- Install https://github.com/arjanadriaanse/lsp-pascal[lsp-pascal], `lsp-mode`, `company` Emacs packages,
- Configure it like this in your `~/.emacs`:
+
[source,lisp]
----
(require 'lsp-pascal)

;; choose LSP server binary
(setq lsp-pascal-command "/home/michalis/sources/castle-engine/castle-engine/bin/pasls")

;; pass basic info to LSP server, all LSP Pascal servers above support these:
(setq lsp-pascal-fpcdir "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/src")
(setq lsp-pascal-lazarusdir "/home/michalis/lazarus")
(setq lsp-pascal-pp "/home/michalis/cge/tools/contrib/fpc/bin/fpc-cge")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctarget "linux")
(setq lsp-pascal-fpctargetcpu "x86_64")
----

=== NeoVim

The LSP server can be used with http://neovim.io/[NeoVim]. See the `client/nvim` subdirectory of https://github.com/Isopod/pascal-language-server/tree/master/client/nvim[Philip Zander\'s repository].
