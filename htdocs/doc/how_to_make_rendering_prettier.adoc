* Use *Physical-Based Rendering (PBR)*.
+
The easiest way to use PBR is by using link:gltf[glTF] format for your assets. glTF by default uses PBR materials. You can design and export glTF with PBR e.g. using link:blender[Blender].
+
You can also read about link:https://github.com/michaliskambi/x3d-tests/wiki/Include-PBR-%28PhysicalMaterial-and-related-concepts%29-in-the-official-X3D-specification[PBR in X3D]. In short: Michalis has designed PBR in X3D 4 to match glTF PBR exactly.

* Use *bump mapping*. In Blender, just set a normalmap texture (texture that affects normal vectors) and export to glTF.
+
Internally we do bump mapping by `Material.normalTexture` or `PhysicalMaterial.normalTexture` X3D fields.

* Use *other textures* (occlusion texture, emission texture, specular and shininess texture (Phong), metallic/roughness texture (PBR)) to provide interesting features varying over the surface.
+
See  `Material` (Phong) or `PhysicalMaterial` (PBR) in https://github.com/michaliskambi/x3d-tests/wiki/X3D-version-4:-New-features-of-materials,-lights-and-textures[X3D 4] for various optional texture slots to affect various additional material parameters.

* _(Phong shading is now default in CGE, no need to do anything.)_
+
If you still use (older, simpler, faster) Phong lighting model, then at least set the _shading_ to Phong (not _Gouraud_). You can http://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shading[set shading per-shape], but usually it's easier to just set `Scene.RenderOptions.PhongShading := true` for the whole scene (TCastleScene instance).
+
Note that Phong shading is activated automatically (for a particular shape) when you use PBR, bump mapping or shadow maps or some other engine effect. So you may not need to actually request it explicitly.

* Use link:x3d_extensions_screen_effects.php[screen effects (post-processing)].
* Use effects like link:x3d_extensions_mirror_plane.php[mirrors] and link:x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php[shadows].
* Use animation blending when appropriate. To do this, set `TCastleScene.DefaultAnimationTransition` to non-zero on your scene, or use `PlayAnimation` with `TPlayAnimationParameters.TransitionDuration` set as non-zero.
* Use link:color_space[linear color space]. It is automatically used with  `PhysicalMaterial`, so it is automatically used with glTF models using PBR. You can set `ColorSpace := csLinear` to just use it always (also with Phong lighting or unlit materials).
+
This makes calculations more correct with respect to reality. This should be turned "on" from the begging of working on your graphic assets -- as it necessarily affects to colors of everything.

* Try and use one of the cgeref:ToneMapping[tone mapping] options if you feel they improve your colors.
