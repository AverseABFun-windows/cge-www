This page is the opposite of the manual page link:manual_optimization.php[How to optimize your games] :)

* Use *Physical-Based Rendering (PBR)*.
+
The easiest way to use PBR is by using link:gltf[glTF] format for your assets. glTF by default uses PBR materials. You can design and export glTF with PBR e.g. using link:creating_data_blender.php[Blender].
+
You can also read about link:https://github.com/michaliskambi/x3d-tests/wiki/Include-PBR-%28PhysicalMaterial-and-related-concepts%29-in-the-official-X3D-specification[PBR in X3D]. In short: Michalis has designed PBR in X3D 4 to match glTF PBR exactly.

* Use *bump mapping*. In Blender, just set a normalmap texture (texture that affects normal vectors) and export to glTF.
+
Internally we do bump mapping by `Material.normalTexture` or `PhysicalMaterial.normalTexture` X3D fields.

////
Deprecated: it is also possible by `CommonSurfaceShader.normalMap` or `Appearance.normalMap`.
+
Deprecated: See http://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_texturing_extensions.php#section_ext_common_surface_shader[ComonSurfaceShader] documentation. Our http://castle-engine.io/creating_data_blender.php[Blender exporter] can export X3D or castle-anim-frames files with the `CommonSurfaceShader` node set up.
////

* Use *other textures* (occlusion texture, emission texture, specular and shininess texture (Phong), metallic/roughness texture (PBR)) to provide interesting features varying over the surface.
+
See  `Material` (Phong) or `PhysicalMaterial` (PBR) in https://github.com/michaliskambi/x3d-tests/wiki/X3D-version-4:-New-features-of-materials,-lights-and-textures[X3D 4] for various optional texture slots to affect various additional material parameters.
* If you still use (older, simpler, faster) Phong lighting model, then at least set the _shading_ to Phong (not _Gouraud_). You can http://castle-engine.io/x3d_implementation_shape_extensions.php#section_ext_shading[set shading per-shape], but usually it's easier to just set `Scene.Attributes.PhongShading := true` for the whole scene (TCastleScene instance).
+
Note that Phong shading is activated automatically (for a particular shape) when you use PBR, bump mapping or shadow maps or some other engine effect. So you may not need to actually request it explicitly.

* Use link:x3d_extensions_screen_effects.php[screen effects (post-processing)].
* Use effects like link:x3d_extensions_mirror_plane.php[mirrors] and link:x3d_extensions_shadow_maps.php[shadows].
* Use animation blending when appropriate. To do this, set `TCastleScene.DefaultAnimationTransition` to non-zero on your scene, or use `PlayAnimation` with `TPlayAnimationParameters.TransitionDuration` set as non-zero.
* Use link:manual_gamma_correction.php[gamma correction]. It is automatically used with  `PhysicalMaterial`, so it is automatically used with glTF models using PBR. You can set `GammaCorrection := gcAlways` to just use it always (also with Phong lighting or unlit materials).
+
This makes calculations more correct with respect to reality. This should be turned "on" from the begging of working on your graphic assets -- as it necessarily affects to colors of everything.

* Try and use one of the https://castle-engine.io/apidoc-unstable/html/CastleRenderOptions.html#ToneMapping[tone mapping] options if you feel they improve your colors.
* You can increase the number of allowed lights per shape using `Scene.Attributes.MaxLightsPerShape`. https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php[view3dscene] has a menu item to experiment with it (_"View \-> Max Lights Per Shape..."_). A test model is in https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models/tree/master/gltf/multiple_animated_lights[demo-models: gltf/multiple_animated_lights].
