## Castle Game Engine Installation

. Download the latest link:index.php[Castle Game Engine]. Unpack the engine ZIP wherever you like.

. Run the _Castle Game Engine_ editor: open the unpacked `castle_game_engine` directory, open the subdirectory `bin` inside and run the `castle-editor` executable.

## Install compiler and IDE

Next, you should install

[role="compact"]
* a Pascal compiler (we support _FPC_ and _Delphi_)
* and a Pascal IDE (like _Lazarus_, _Delphi_, _Visual Studio Code_, or any other text editor you prefer).

For a fully open-source cross-platform environment _we recommend FPC and Lazarus_.

### FPC and Lazarus

. Install FPC and Lazarus.
+
Windows:: Download and run a simple installer from the link:https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus website] that will install both _Lazarus_ (IDE) and _FPC_ (compiler).
Linux:: You should
+
[role="compact"]
--
- install https://www.freepascal.org/[FPC] first. It is easiest to install a package called `fpc` using your package manager.
- Then download and install link:https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[Lazarus package] for Linux.
- To compile the applications, install also GTK and OpenGL development libraries, from packages like `libgtk2.0-dev`, `libgl-dev` on Debian-based distros.
--
+
macOS:: You can download packages for both FPC (download file like `fpc-3.2.2.intelarm64-macosx.dmg`) and Lazarus (file like `Lazarus-2.2.0-0-x86_64-macosx.pkg`) from link:https://www.lazarus-ide.org/[the downloads on Lazarus website].
+

+
TIP: You can install _FPC_ and _Lazarus_ in other ways, for example link:fpcupdeluxe[using FpcUpDeluxe].
+
TIP: If you prefer other IDE than _Lazarus_, you can install link:https://www.freepascal.org/[only FPC] and use any Pascal code editor you like, like link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code].

. Configure FPC and Lazarus locations in  _Castle Game Engine_ editor _Preferences_, if they have not been auto-detected correctly.
+
cgeimg::block[cge_editor_prefs.png|Castle Game Engine Editor Preferences]

. In _Castle Game Engine_ editor _Preferences_, go to tab _FPC and Lazarus_ and click on the button _"Register Lazarus Packages"_. This will allow to compile and debug CGE applications inside Lazarus.

////
. CGE editor is now integrated with FPC and Lazarus.
** Press F9 to compile the project from CGE editor (using CGE build tool which will use FPC under the hood).
** Double-click on Pascal files to open them in Lazarus.
** Use _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item to open project in Lazarus.
////

### Alternative: Delphi

. Download https://www.embarcadero.com/products/Delphi[Delphi].
+
NOTE: Free https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/free-download[Community Edition] is fine. Though it doesn't have a working `dcc` compiler, so compiling using F9 in CGE editor will not work. But you can simply open the project in Delphi and use F9 from _Delphi_.
+
NOTE: link:supported_compilers.php[Details about supported Delphi versions are here.]

. In _Castle Game Engine_ editor, open _Preferences_ dialog. In both the _Code Editor_ and _Compilation_ tabs set _Delphi_, if it was not auto-detected automatically.

////
. CGE editor is now integrated with Delphi.
** Press F9 to compile the project from CGE editor (using CGE build tool which will use Delphi command-line compiler under the hood).
** Double-click on Pascal files to open them in Delphi.
** Use _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item to open project in Delphi.
** Note: as Delphi _Community Edition_ doesn't have command-line compiler, you have to compile the project using F9 in Delphi.
