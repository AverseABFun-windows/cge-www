# Use engine inside Lazarus form using TCastleControl
include::common.adoc[]

## Introduction

cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] is a component you can drop on a Lazarus (LCL) form. It allows to do all CGE rendering and processing as part of a form, and cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] can be surrounded on your form by any other components.

NOTE: This feature is right now available only for Lazarus (LCL) users. We plan to add it for Delphi, maybe both VCL and FMX, soon.

## Comparison between TCastleWindowBase and TCastleControlBase

Most of this manual describes the process of using the engine with the cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[] instead of cgeref:TCastleControlBase[].  All new projects created from editor templates use cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[]. We generally advise cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[], as:

- cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[] works on all CGE platforms (desktop, mobile - link:android[Android], link:ios[iOS], consoles - link:nintendo_switch[Nintendo Switch], upcoming _web target_). It allows us to have true cross-platform projects, that can be recompiled to any supported platform out-of-the-box.

- cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[] allows us to handle events and message loop on the CGE side, and make it efficient. For example, it makes _mouse look_ work perfectly smooth.

On the other hand, using the cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] has one big benefit: as you place the control inside a form, you can surround it with all the standard LCL GUI controls. So you can use numerous LCL GUI controls, with native look on all desktop systems, together with _Castle Game Engine_.

We are committed to supporting both approaches (cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] and cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[]) in the foreseeable future.

### It is not allowed to use both `TCastleWindowBase` and `TCastleControlBase` in a single application

You have to make a choice:

- Use cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[]. Use the cgeref:Application[] singleton from cgeref:CastleWindow[] unit to manage these windows.

- Use cgeref:TCastleControlBase[]. Use the LCL forms, along with LCL `Application` singleton in the `Forms` unit, to manage your application.

You cannot mix these approaches, as neither LCL (in which our cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] works) nor cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[] are prepared to handle the situation that they only handle *some* application forms, and other library handles the other forms.

That is also why we have separate packages

-  `castle_window.lpk` (with cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[]) and

- `castle_components.lpk` (with cgeref:TCastleControlBase[]; a better name would be `castle_lcl.lpk`).

You should not use both of these packages at the same time.

Note that, if you use cgeref:TCastleControlBase[], it is OK to have multiple cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] instances visible at the same time. Similarly, if you use cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[], you can have several cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[] instances visible at the same time (but only on desktop platforms), see https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/window/multi_window[examples/window/multi_window].

## Using TCastleControlBase

. Install in Lazarus the package `castle_components.lpk`. In the package dialog, use the option to _"Install"_ (under the _"Use"_ button).
+
Note: Installing the `castle_components` package will also automatically install the package `castle_base`, as a dependency. That's good.
+

  lazarus-install-32.png|castle_components: Install,
  lazarus-install-33.png|castle_components: Confirm Lazarus rebuild
]
--
+
Once `castle_components.lpk` is successfully installed, Lazarus restarts, and you should see the _"Castle"_ tab with our components.

. Create a normal new LCL project (using Lazarus _"New Project"_ menu item). Choose _"Application"_.

. Pick `TCastleControlBase` from the component palette (tab _"Castle"_) and drop it on a regular Lazarus form.

. Done. Press "Run" :)

See the engine examples in link:https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/master/examples/lazarus[examples/lazarus/] subdirectory for various demos of this approach.

## Opening in CGE editor

You can place a simple link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] within your project, like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<project name="my_project"
  lazarus_project="my_project.lpi"
  build_using_lazbuild="true"
>
</project>
----

This way you can open this project in the CGE editor, and compile/run it. The line `build_using_lazbuild="true"` means that CGE editor and CGE link:build_tool[build tool] will invoke `lazbuild` under the hood.

## Initializing the resources

Essentially, you can initialize your game resources at any time. Even before any cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] exists. For example in the `OnCreate` event of a main form.

Initializing resources inside the cgeref:TCastleControlBase.OnOpen[] is also a good choice, in typical cases. Since OpenGL context is available at this point, the engine will be able to initialize also GPU resources for things you instantiate at this point.

But note that cgeref:TCastleControlBase.OnOpen[] runs each time a form with cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] is opened. Depending on your LCL application organization, if you allow to open this form many times -- then cgeref:TCastleControlBase.OnOpen[] will happen many times. In this case, to execute something really *once*, just folow the usual LCL approaches (e.g. initialize from a main form, or even from the main program).

## Loading user interface and state

You can load a design (file `xxx.castle-user-interface`) and you can use cgeref:TUIState[] within the cgeref:TCastleControlBase[], just as with cgeref:TCastleWindowBase[]. You can add new _state_ using CGE editor, or just define a new unit like this:

[source,pascal]
----
unit GameStateMain;

interface

uses CastleUIState;

type
  TStateMain = class(TUIState)
  private
    { Components designed using CGE editor, loaded from gamestatemain.castle-user-interface. }
    // ...
  public
    constructor Create(AOwner: TComponent); override;
    procedure Start; override;
  end;

var
  StateMain: TStateMain;

implementation

constructor TStateMain.Create(AOwner: TComponent);
begin
  inherited;
  DesignUrl := 'castle-data:/gamestatemain.castle-user-interface';
end;

procedure TStateMain.Start;
begin
  inherited;
end;

end.
----

That's enough to load `gamestatemain.castle-user-interface` design from your `data` subdirectory.

To initialize this state in your application, you can use this code in cgeref:TCastleControlBase.OnOpen[] :

[source,pascal]
----
TCastleControlBase.MainControl := MyCastleControl;

StateMain := TStateMain.Create(Application);
TUIState.Current := StateMain;
----

NOTE: We have an improvement to this approach coming, in branch https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/uistate-to-view[uistate-to-view]. Setting the singleton `TCastleControlBase.MainControl` will not be necessary soon. The example how it will work is in https://github.com/castle-engine/castle-engine/tree/uistate-to-view/examples/lazarus/model_3d_with_2d_controls[examples/lazarus/model_3d_with_2d_controls] in that branch. It is not yet merged to `master` branch.

## Focus (receiving key input)

Like every LCL control, our cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] receives the keys only when it has _focus_. The control _does not_ capture all the keys pressed over the form (this would be bad, as other controls, maybe even other cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] on the same form, may want to handle them). To make sure that controlling the camera by keys (like AWSD or arrows) works, make sure that your control has a focus.

You can call `MyCastleControl.SetFocus;` at any time to explicitly make the `MyCastleControl` focused. You can assign this to some menu item, or key shortcut handled by form, to allow user to easily switch focus to the cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] instance.

Alternative approach is to make cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] the only control on the form that can receive focus. This makes things simple, cgeref:TCastleControlBase[] will always have focus. But it means limiting yourself what you use on a form. E.g. all buttons should be `TSpeedButton` (unfocusable button in LCL).
