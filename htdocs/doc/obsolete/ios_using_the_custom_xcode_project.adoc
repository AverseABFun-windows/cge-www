# iOS Using the Custom XCode Project
include::common.adoc[]

== When to use this approach

**Deprecated: The approach described on this page is deprected. The latest CGE has a better approach to create cross-platform games, including iOS. It is described on link:manual_cross_platform.php[Cross-platform apps] page. Generally it just works out-of-the-box with all CGE projects. It uses the link:build_tool[build tool] to compile and package your game for iOS. You can even link:ios_services[integrate with a number of services like Apple Game Center], and the build tool will take care of everything (generating the necessary XCode project to actually release your app for iOS).**

There is an alternative way to use the engine on iOS. You can compile the library defined in the `src/library` engine code to a static library (.a). Then you can add this library to your custom Xcode project.

This approach is useful if you want to use the engine as a VRML/X3D file viewer, and wrap it in a custom code and user-interface in XCode.

An example application using this approach is located in `examples/library/ios_tester`.

== Installing and testing FPC cross-compilers

First, you need to install FPC with cross-compilers, just like described on the link:ios[iOS] page.

== Compiling and testing the library

Compile the engine library `cge_library.a` by:

----
cd <castle-engine>/src/library/
./compile-iOS.sh
----

The script automatically compiles a static library that works with both a real device and the iPhoneSimulator.

And now you can open an example XCode project in `castle_game_engine/examples/library/ios_tester/`, run it (_Command + R_), and see that it works in the simulator!

_Note: you can uncomment debug or release compile flags inside `compile-iOS.sh`._

== Creating your own iOS project in XCode

Unlike Android version of your app, the engine relies on OpenGL ES context prepared by iOS SDK in Xcode. So for this, just create a new Xcode iOS project. The easiest way to work with OpenGL ES on iOS is to use GLKViewController and GLKView.

Once correctly prepared (either from Storyboard or entirely from code), add compiled library (cge_library.a) and the header file (castleengine.h) to the project. In source code, just initialize the engine calling the appropriate functions, and connect _update_ function of GLKViewController with CGE_Update() and _glkView:drawInRect:_ to CGE_Render().

Please refer to ios_tester project in castle_game_engine/examples/library.

All resources needed by your app have to be added to the Xcode project as in any other iOS app. Xcode will automatically copy them to the compiled bundle.

== Implementing User Interaction

To enable user interaction to the engine, there is only one possibility at the moment: simulate mouse events. Add tap, pan and/or pinch gesture recognizers to the GLKView, and pass the events to the engine. Please refer to the example ios_tester project again. As a downside of this approach, there is no multi-touch support possible. We plan to support and process multi-touch gestures automatically in the engine in the future.

== Summary

To describe the process when using the library interface:

. Compile the library using castle_game_engine/src/library/compile-iOS.sh
. Add cge_library.a and castleengine.h to your Xcode project
. Prepare GLKViewController and init the OpenGL ES context
. Init the engine (CGE_Open, CGE_SetUserInterface, CGE_Resize, CGE_Close)
. Connect GLKViewController update and draw to CGE_Update and CGE_Render
. Process touch gestures
