. _Compile_ and _Run_ the project using the editor _Run_ menu. Or just press F9.
+
NOTE: First compilation of a new project needs to build the engine as well. Subsequent compilations will be lighting fast.
+
The compilation uses link:build_tool[Castle Game Engine command-line build tool], which in turn will use _FPC_ or _Delphi_ under the hood.


. Double-click on Pascal files to open them in your IDE.
+
Use _"Code -> Open Project in Code Editor"_ menu item to open the whole project in IDE.

. That's it! The world is your oyster now :)
+
Open and try numerous example projects from the engine `examples` subdirectory. Open them in the editor by _Open Project_ and point at the example's link:project_manifest[CastleEngineManifest.xml] file.
