# Components to reuse a design in other designs: TCastleDesign and TCastleTransformDesign

:description: Use TCastleDesign and TCastleTransformDesign to reuse a composition of components, similar to Unity prefabs.

== Introduction

Components cgeref:TCastleDesign[] and cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] allow you to instantiate (reuse) in one design file a component designed in another design file. This is similar to how Unity prefabs are used.

== Overview

The general idea is simple:

- You can reuse a composition of components, that you have designed in CGE editor, multiple times.

- You can reuse a UI (cgeref:TCastleUserInterface[]). Reuse by cgeref:TCastleDesign[].

- You can reuse a transform (cgeref:TCastleTransform[] - 3D or 2D stuff that can be placed in a link:viewport_and_scenes[viewport]). Reuse by cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[].

Any design file (`.castle-user-interface` or `.castle-transform`) can be loaded (instantiated) by cgeref:TCastleDesign[] and cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[]). To create such design file, with any component as a root, you can use:

- Menu item _"Design -> New Xxx (Custom Root) -> Xxx"_

- Or save any component to file using _"Save Selected..."_ command (right-click on the component in hierarchy).

Then you can reuse it:

- by manually adding cgeref:TCastleDesign[] or cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] to new designs. Set their `URL` property to the design that contains the component to be reused.

- Or just drag-and-drop a `.castle-user-interface` or `.castle-transform` file on your design.

See the context menu (right-click) of the cgeref:TCastleDesign[] or cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] for some helpful commands:

- _"Edit (Copy Here) Referenced Design"_ (detach from the referenced design file)

- _"Revert To Referenced Design"_ (use after _"Edit (Copy Here) Referenced Design"_; this removes all the children and reverts back to the original design file)

- _"Open Referenced Design"_ (an easy way to open design in the `URL` of this cgeref:TCastleDesign[] or cgeref:TCastleTransformDesign[] component).
