<p><strong>Obsolete: unfortunately, this backend was not merged, and it is not maintained anymore. It is recommended to use regular Linux backends (like X or GTK) on Raspberry Pi instead.</strong></p>

<p>A new <a href="CastleWindow backends">CastleWindow backend</a>, right now available only in the fork <a href="https://github.com/JPGygax68/castle-engine" class="bare">https://github.com/JPGygax68/castle-engine</a> . It allows to use Castle Game Engine on the Raspberry Pi without X or Wayland.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>THIS BACKEND IS EXPERIMENTAL!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please report all questions and problems to:
Jean-Pierre Gygax <a href="mailto:gygax@practicomp.ch">gygax@practicomp.ch</a> ("JPNotADragon" on the
"castle-engine" Discord network).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use this backend, define the preprocessor symbols
CASTLE_ENGINE_RASPBERRY_PI and CASTLE_WINDOW_DISPMANX. You can do this in
your personal Freepascal configuration file <code>~/.fpc.cfg</code>. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>  #include /etc/fpc.cfg
  -dCASTLE_ENGINE_RASPBERRY_PI
  -dCASTLE_WINDOW_DISPMANX
  -Fl/opt/vc/lib/</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first symbol is not actually related to the backend, but switches the
engine from OpenGL to OpenGL ES (version 2), which is necessary since
the Pi only supports the latter in hardware. The <code>-Fl</code> option tells
Freepascal where to find the Broadcom libraries (if you have admin access,
you can also add this search path globally in <code>/etc/fpc.cfg</code>).</p>

<h2 id="_what_this_backend_does">1. What this backend does</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This backend makes it possible to use the Castle Game Engine on the
Raspberry Pi under Linux (tested with Raspbian) without X or Wayland.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is possible because Broadcom (the manufacturer of the System-on-Chip)
provides a low-level graphics API called DispmanX, which, in cooperation
with several other Broadcom-provided libraries, makes it possible to
access the Pi&#8217;s VideoCore 4 chip, configure the connected display and
then draw on it via GLESv2 (using EGL for housekeeping and presentation tasks).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For input, the DispmanX backend relies on the <code>/dev/input/eventX</code> files
provided by Linux. By listening to all of those device files, the backend
gets informed about touchpad, mouse, and keyboard input (read about limitations
below), which it translates and relays to the engine as all backends do.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="_notes_and_limitations">2. Notes and limitations:</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have only ever used this backend on my FT5406 7" touch display (the
"official" display for the Raspberry Pi). It should work on other
displays - please test and report!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Touch input is supposed to work, but wasn&#8217;t formally tested and green-lighted (the <code>draw_toy</code> example app does not seem to work correctly, and we haven&#8217;t yet established why that is).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mouse input has yet to be reviewed by the engine author. Currently,
the mouse pointer starts at the center of the screen, but is totally
unconstrained in all directions. This will most probably change soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyboard input is somewhat limited in that, as is the case for all
backends except GTK and Windows, it does not use keymaps, so that text
input is in effect limited to US ASCII. (We have a couple of ideas on how
to address this, so please inform us if that particular limitation is a
concern to you).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This backend does not currently take any of the configuration options
(such as multisampling) into account. (Though it does enable the maximum
level of multisampling available on the Pi, which is 4 - there&#8217;s just no
way to select a different value right now.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_tip">3. Tip</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though a CGE game built with the DispmanX backend <em>can</em> apparently be launched while the X desktop is active, that is probably not a good idea, since X will then continue to receive all the same input that your game does. One of the ways to stop the X server (Raspbian) is:</p>
