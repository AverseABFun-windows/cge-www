# Camera
include::common.adoc[]

Camera determines what do you see in the viewport. It defines 3 vectors:

. cgeref:TCastleCamera.Position[] - observer position.
. cgeref:TCastleCamera.Direction[] - direction in which you look.
. cgeref:TCastleCamera.Up[] - together with _direction_, the _up_ vector determines the camera _orientation_.

Camera also defines _projection_:

* cgeref:TCastleCamera.ProjectionType[] - determines _perspective_ or _orthographic_ projection.
* cgeref:TCastleCamera.Perspective[], cgeref:TCastleCamera.Orthographic[] - these subcomponents allow to configure projection details.

See the link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 3D world] and link:viewport_3d[Tutorial: Designing a 2D world] to see the typical workflow how do you manipulate the camera using the editor.
