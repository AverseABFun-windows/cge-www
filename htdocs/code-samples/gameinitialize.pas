  { You should not need to do *anything* more in the unit "initialization" section.
    Most of your game initialization should happen inside ApplicationInitialize.
    In particular, it is not allowed to read files before ApplicationInitialize
    is called (in case of non-desktop platforms, some necessary things
    may not be prepared yet). }
