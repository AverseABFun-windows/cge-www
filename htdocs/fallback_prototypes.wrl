#VRML V2.0 utf8

# This VRML file specifies "fallback" prototypes for extensions
# of Kambi VRML game engine,
# [http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/kambi_vrml_extensions.php].
#
# This file will *not* be used by Kambi VRML game engine programs
# (like view3dscene), as they have appropriate nodes simply built-in.
#
# This file may be used by other VRML browsers so that they are able
# to partially understand these extension nodes, or at least omit them
# gracefullly.
