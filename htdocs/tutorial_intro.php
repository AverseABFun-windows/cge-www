This tutorial shows how to make a simple 3D first-person game using our <i>Castle Game Engine</i>. We'll explain the basics of our engine, show you some simple programs and mention the most important classes.

Throughout this tutorial you will see a links to our <a>engine reference</a>, and you will eventually want to follow them to read detailed reference of stuff that interests you. Note that you can also just read the units source code --- the reference is automatically generated from the comments in the units interface, so if you're brave enough, you can just dive straight into the source.
