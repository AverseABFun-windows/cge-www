<p>This tutorial shows how to make a simple 3D first-person game using
our <?php echo a_href_page('Castle Game Engine', 'engine'); ?>. We'll
explain the basics of our engine, show you some simple programs and
mention the most important classes.</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial you will see a links to our <?php echo
a_href_page('engine reference', 'reference'); ?>, and you will
eventually want to follow them to read detailed reference of stuff
that interests you. Note that you can also just read the units source
code &mdash; the reference is automatically generated from the
comments in the units interface, so if you're brave enough, you can
just dive straight into the source.</p>
