  Following last news post, work on engine 2.0.0 continues.

  As part of it, I decided to rename one of the most important new classes: TBase3D to a new name "T3D". (Reasoning: this is a shorter and better name. "Base" prefix was just uncomfortable, esp. since descendants were no longer "base" 3D objects but they were have to be called "TBase3D" in many places.)

  Also, T[Custom]Translated/Listetc3D. renamed to T3DXxx. That is, I moved the "3D" part of the name to the beginning. (Reasoning: looks just better, and is consequent with usage of other common prefixes like TKamXxx and TVRMLXxx classes. General rule is that "common part should be the prefix, not suffix", as this is easier to see (and presents itself better when identifiers are sorted alphabetically in API docs etc.).)

  These renamed concern only new classes, not released anyway yet (and we know anyway that engine 2.0.0 will break some compatibility, so let's take this opportunity and "get" the important classes names right, Ok?).

  Note: I edited previous news post (about engine 2.0.0) to reflect these renames. I don't usually edit my news posts after publishing :), but in this case I decided to fix it (only the mentioned classes renames, nothing more, so you don't have to read it again :) ). Otherwise previous news post, quite important, would be nonsense, with invalid URLs to API docs.

  Continuing engine 2.0.0 work, the "castle" source code was just ported to use SceneManager features. This means that previous TLevelObject hierarchy is now a T3D hierarchy (actually, TLevelObject was one of the inspirations for T3D tree; but it didn't handle VRML/X3D events well, unlike our new T3D). This also means that castle's levels (both base level 3D files, and level helper 3D files (for buttons etc.)) can now use fully possibilities of VRML/X3D events.

  To celebrate that,

  1. I added many new animated eye-candy to the "The Fountain" level (one of the "demo" levels, unlocked from the beginning for anyone). There's some animated water with reflections + refractions by shaders (actually taken from a similar kambi_vrml_test_suite demo), there's KambiScript usage (this fountain droplets, aka "poor man's particle engine"), there's some demo of VRML/X3D events providing interactive behavior of the level (TODO) etc. Enjoy!

     (For people with poor GPUs, a short video showing walking around the level is here TODO. But of course I encourage you to actually play the game, as it feels even better when you're inside the game. You can get the game from SVN, or wait for the next release.)

  2. To emphasize that this closes most important castle's technical lack, and to emphasize that "castle", as the game, is considered "finished" now (only imoprtant bugfixes from now), next castle release will be marked by 1.0.0.

     No fanfares, please, as 1.0.0 will have the same basic gameplay as last 0.8.3. It's rather to emphasize that we're working on castle 2.0.0 now :)
