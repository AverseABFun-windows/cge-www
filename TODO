next update:
- initialize counter for glplotter_and_gen_function
- release new glplotter and gen_function
- glplotter (minor ver++) released: GUI greatly improved: Open/Add menu items to open graphs from files and to generate graphs from function expressions. This means that now you don't have to specify graphs at command-line, and now you don't have to write pipes with gen_function. Also documentation and some options translated finally to English.

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
