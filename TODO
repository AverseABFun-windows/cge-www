Text for next update:
After next update:
- run init_counters to init blender_stuff counter

next update:
<li>New demo level for <link "The Castle">: the fountain, done in pure VRML 2.0
  format (no more VRML 1.0).</li>
<li>Prototypes (both <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt>)
  VRML 2.0 feature is fully implemented now !</li>
<li>For view3dscene, default blending dest factor is
  <tt>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</tt>, since this is expected by most VRML authors.</li>
<li>VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (DirectionalLight affects
  every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking <tt>radius</tt> into account).<li>
<li><tt>ROUTE</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now.
  Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything.
  So at least scenes using routes are partially handled (routes are simply
  ignored), instead of just producing an error.</li>
<li>VRML files compressed by gzip are handled OK even if they have
  normal <tt>.wrl</tt> extension.</li>
<li>--write-to-vrml fixed</li>
<li>Handling of colors (<tt>color</tt>, <tt>colorPerVertex</tt>,
  <tt>colorIndex</tt>) for <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> and <tt>IndexedLineSet</tt>
  done.</li>
<li>kambi_vrml_test_suite (major ver++): many new tests to test new
  features (protos, external protos, colors, light scope, running path to test
  NavigationInfo.speed),
  some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle,
  relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</li>
<li><?php echo a_href_page('Blender VRML stuff page added,
  with improved VRML 2.0 exporter and kanim exporter', 'blender_stuff'); ?>.</li>
<li>Everything is compiled using new FPC 2.2.0.</li>
<li>Numerous memory and speed optimizations to load VRML models and animations
  faster and better, also "The Castle" "loading creatures" is less resource
  consuming now.</li>
<li>NavigationInfo.speed is now handled correctly (it sets speed per second)</li>
<li>Engine is ported and works flawlessly on x86-64 on Linux.
  No more only 32-bit :) This also results in the change of archive binary names:
  they all get <tt>i386</tt> after their name, eventually I may release
  precompiled versions for <tt>x86-64</tt> too.</li>
<li>Fixed hang (actually, a really really long delay) when closing sound device
  in "The Castle" on Linuxs (actually, with OpenAL sample implementation).</li>
<li>Shadow volumes silhouette optimization improved: now models don't have
  to be perfect manifold to use this. See
  <tt>kambi_vrml_game_engine/3dmodels.gl/examples/shadow_volume_test/</tt>
  demo, in praticular the <tt>shadow_volume_test_ball_with_tentacles.sh</tt>
  example.</li>
<li>GLWindow allows to change cursor shape.</li>

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
