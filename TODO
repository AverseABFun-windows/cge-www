Next WWW update:
- add bump mapping to "the castle", or update kambi_vrml_extensions file
Text for next update:
- bump mapping
- Wavefront OBJ improved (we handle normal vectors, materials, textures)
- Our blender VRML 97 exporter script improved: set solid/set smooth/autosmooth/autosmooth degrees settings from Blender are correctly exported to VRML file (as creasteAngle field)
- I dropped my custom OpenGLh binding in favor of using GL, GLU, GLExt units.
  OpenGLh was developed when FPC had no usable OpenGL binding unit (neither had Delphi)...
  Times have changed, and current GL, GLU, GLExt units are usable, and (thanks to my patches, like
  http://www.mail-archive.com/fpc-devel@lists.freepascal.org/msg02328.html and
  http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7570 and, most of all,
  http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7600)
  it works good and supports OpenGL 2.0 functions. (while OpenGLh was on GL 1.2 + many extensions level).

After next update:
- regen vrml_engine_doc for html chunked, use.id.as.filename is very important.
  Fix HTML links to vrml_engine_doc to use it.
