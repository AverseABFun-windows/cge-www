Next WWW update:
- finish X3D:
  - test ComposedShader with X3D XML on some external example,
    to be sure I handle it right.

    test on
    /home/michalis/3dmodels/openlibraries/trunk/media/models/
    hm, require setting uniform from SFNode first...

bbox calculation can be merged into one if
TNodeX3DComposedGeometryNode has virtual
Index: method (returning nil for non-indexed).

Implement PrimitiveSets:
    [Indexed] Triangle/Quad Set/Strip/Fan for X3D.
    6 triangle, 2 quad primitives.

Some general notes (maybe copy to implementation comments):

- The value of the colorPerVertex field is ignored and always
  treated as TRUE for all 8 of these. Normals, if specified by user,
  are always per-vertex.
  So always SMOOTH shading model is safe.

  For our own generated normals, we may be forced to generate
  flat ones (for non-indexed ones, or for indexed with normalPerVertex=FALSE).
  PROBLEM when there are colors (always per vertex) and normals must be flat,
  we HAVE to decompose into triangles?

- Good implementation, and ours should be like that, should keep
  whole strip/fan as one OpenGL strip/fan. In other words, we're going
  to utilize the optimal representation of these primitives, and we'll not
  deconstruct strips/fans to simple sets of triangles.

- As for smoothing: for indexed primitives:

    * If normalPerVertex is TRUE, the normal shall be the average of all triangles sharing that vertex.
    * If normalPerVertex is FALSE, the normal shall be generated for the triangle based on the ccw field.

  For non-indexed, for some primitives normals should be generated flat,
  and for some normalPerVertex is taken into account just like above.

  Anyway, there's no creaseAngle. So some simple normals calculator
  is in order.

- Looks like generation of tex Coords is not needed: if not supplied,
  do not use texture? Let's make it possible to easily plug generation,
  like the one for IndexedFaceSet.

Also impl LineSet (non-indexed) from X3D.

    http://www.instantreality.org/tutorial/shader-programs/
    some instantreality.org example models?

  - update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features.
    vrml_implementation_status updated.

  - vrml_engine_doc is somewhat updated, update more, and regerenate output

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada and X3D.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.
