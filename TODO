Next WWW update:
- finish X3D:
  - add all nodes with fields, with whole X3D abstract hierarchy.
    Fix TNodeX3DGroupingNode to inherit from some TNodeX3D... other node.
    Fix all geometry nodes to inherit from X3DGeometryNode.
    Fix Text node to have solid field (and others? check spec)

    Add to tests auto creation of all registered nodes,
    and check do they have all fields with different names.

  - test ComposedShader with X3D XML on some external example,
    to be sure I handle it right.

- update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features, vrml_implementation_status
  (note that it's X3D edition 2, i.e. current spec at 2008-05,
  note that all fields besides MFImage are supported,
  note that all components are known and parsed).
  about X3D.

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.

also TNodeGroupHidden rename to TVRMLGroupHidden (or TVRMLRootGroup)
TNodeGeneralTexture also change to TVRMLXxx
TVRMLLightNode

after all done, remember to fix containerField to all nodes.

make sure the partial X3D components are finished now:
- navigation
  pointing_device_sensor
  shaders

test: pure VRML 2.0 should still be output as VRML 2.0, not X3D
(add optional output 1st header line to run_tests.sh for view3dscene)

drop AllowedChildrenNodes for group, add to test that they all descend
from X3DChildNode.
