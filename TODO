- fix extensions, post to Joerg

- to actually test and see color on 8 geom prims, we have to use
  smooth shading there.

Next WWW update:
- finish X3D:
  - test ComposedShader with X3D XML on some external example,
    to be sure I handle it right.

    test on
    /home/michalis/3dmodels/openlibraries/trunk/media/models/
    hm, require setting uniform from SFNode first...

bbox calculation can be merged into one if
TNodeX3DComposedGeometryNode has virtual
Index: method (returning nil for non-indexed).

Some general notes (maybe copy to implementation comments):

- For our own generated normals, we may be forced to generate
  flat ones (for non-indexed ones, or for indexed with normalPerVertex=FALSE).
  PROBLEM when there are colors (always per vertex) and normals must be flat,
  we HAVE to decompose into triangles?

  Or just say that normalPerVertex = FALSE connected with existing
  colors (since colorPerVertex = TRUE always) don't work?

- As for smoothing: for indexed primitives:

    * If normalPerVertex is TRUE, the normal shall be the average of all triangles sharing that vertex.
    * If normalPerVertex is FALSE, the normal shall be generated for the triangle based on the ccw field.

  For non-indexed, for some primitives normals should be generated flat,
  and for some normalPerVertex is taken into account just like above.

  Anyway, there's no creaseAngle. So some simple normals calculator
  is in order.

Also impl LineSet (non-indexed) from X3D.

    http://www.instantreality.org/tutorial/shader-programs/
    some instantreality.org example models?

  - update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features.
    vrml_implementation_status updated.

  - vrml_engine_doc is somewhat updated, update more, and regerenate output

- Hopefully next engine releasew will support events, with interpolators and at least most basic sensors (TimeSensor, TouchSensor, KeySensor).

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada and X3D.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.
