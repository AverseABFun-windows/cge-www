Next WWW update:
- release new glplotter and gen_function, view3dscene
Text for next update:
- glplotter (minor ver++) released: GUI greatly improved: Open/Add menu items to open graphs from files and to generate graphs from function expressions. This means that now you don't have to specify graphs at command-line, and now you don't have to write pipes with gen_function. Also documentation and some options translated finally to English.
- view3dscene (release ver++) released: fixed crash when removing geometry node from VRML 2.0 hierarchy. Fixed jagged animation when world time was really large (usually occurs when "on display" time pass was really large for some time). Fixed messing the gravity "up" vector when reopening the scene.
- <a href="changes_log_feed.php">RSS feed</a> listing all changes is available now. <small>SouceForge already made RSS feeds for our project, but they didn't allow me HTML code there, and HTML links are simply useful for my changes_log messages.</small>
After next update:
- initialize counter for glplotter_and_gen_function

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
