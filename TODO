Next WWW update:
- finish X3D XML support (reread spec, finish all details),
  in particular: prototypes, and special parsing of Script nodes
  (and shaders --- should I make this somewhat wider feature,
  like
    HasInterfaceDeclarations: idNone, idRestricted, idAll
  public read, protected SetInterfaceDeclarations to use in constructors.
  setting this to idNone frees InterfaceDeclarations, setting to <> idNone
  creates if needed InterfaceDeclarations object.
  This should take care of Script and some shader nodes in one go.
- update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features, vrml_implementation_status
  about X3D.

Text for next update:
