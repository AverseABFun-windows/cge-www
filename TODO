- fix extensions, post to Joerg

Next WWW update:
- finish X3D:
  - test ComposedShader with X3D XML on some external example,
    to be sure I handle it right.

    test on
    /home/michalis/3dmodels/openlibraries/trunk/media/models/
    hm, require setting uniform from SFNode first...

bbox calculation can be merged into one if
TNodeX3DComposedGeometryNode has virtual
Index: method (returning nil for non-indexed).

- finish triangulating methods for primitives

    http://www.instantreality.org/tutorial/shader-programs/
    some instantreality.org example models?

  - update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features.
    vrml_implementation_status updated.

  - vrml_engine_doc is somewhat updated, update more, and regerenate output

- Hopefully next engine releasew will support events, with interpolators and at least most basic sensors (TimeSensor, TouchSensor, KeySensor).

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada and X3D.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.
