After next update:

next view3dscene update:
- Prototypes (both <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt>) VRML 2.0 feature is fully implemented now !
- For view3dscene, default blending dest factor is GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, since this is expected by most VRML authors
- VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (DirectionalLight affects every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking radius into account)
- <tt>ROUTE</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now. Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything. So at least scenes using routes are partially handled (routes are simply ignored), instead of just producing an error.
<li>VRML files compressed by gzip are handled OK even if they have normal <tt>.wrl</tt> extension.</li>
<li>--write-to-vrml fixed</li>
<li>Handling of colors (<tt>color</tt>, <tt>colorPerVertex</tt>, <tt>colorIndex</tt>) for <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> and <tt>IndexedLineSet</tt> done.</li>
<li>kambi_vrml_test_suite (major ver++): many new tests to test new features (protos, external protos, colors, light scope), some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle, relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</li>

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
