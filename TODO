Remaining view3dscene 3.4 blockers (bugfix only now):

  it's ultra-slow at loading, just like cubemap_gen_in_dynamic_world.
    It's in Cache.Fonts_IncReference!
    Not reproducible on 32 bit (fpc 2.2.4 kocury/linux/32), so it must be some 64-bit problem.
    Profile.

    The slowness is inside gluTessVertex in TGLOutlineFont.Create. Which means I cannot do anything about it? It's the GLU tesselators that are much slower on x86_64, it seems.

    One solution could be to cache the tesselated result. I could even compile the cached result into the program, this way user doesn't have to do it at all.
    Trouble: is it really helpful in the long run? I would like some time to load fonts from TTF files and then runtime tesselation is a must. And then caching helps, but not for the 1st tesselation run...

    Maybe just not tesselating all letters would be useful?
    This would be a valid optimization (needed in the long run anyway, for Unicode fonts I wouldn't want to tesselate all characters at loading anyway).
    For now, possibly I would just need basic ASCII support, so not all 256 characters need to be defined?
