- fix proto_events_test_3.x3dv, working with "on IS ..." three times

- fix EXTERNPROTO to also honour events: don't create dummy TVRMLPrototypeNode copy, this is useless and moreover will destroy events "IS" references. Just expand existing TVRMLPrototypeNode with loaded prototype (instead of current extern prototype)

- mention of vrml_status: event work, but not in a PROTO inside a PROTO (VRMLNodeDeepCopy looses PrototypeSourceNode info, this should be fixed by making better VRMLNodeDeepCopy implementation (as make it as TVRMLNode.DeepCopy method)

Next WWW update:
- generate and upload new vrml_engine_doc
- generate and upload new apidoc
- check html validity and links, since a lot changed
- start vrml_time_origin_considered_uncomfortable counter
Text for next update:

  Also, specify more open that it's "VRML / X3D browser, and viewer for other 3D formats"
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.
