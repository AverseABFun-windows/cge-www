- run init_counters to init blender_stuff counter

next view3dscene update:
<li>Prototypes (both <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt>)
  VRML 2.0 feature is fully implemented now !</li>
<li>For view3dscene, default blending dest factor is
  <tt>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</tt>, since this is expected by most VRML authors.</li>
<li>VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (DirectionalLight affects
  every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking <tt>radius</tt> into account).<li>
<li><tt>ROUTE</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now.
  Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything.
  So at least scenes using routes are partially handled (routes are simply
  ignored), instead of just producing an error.</li>
<li>VRML files compressed by gzip are handled OK even if they have
  normal <tt>.wrl</tt> extension.</li>
<li>--write-to-vrml fixed</li>
<li>Handling of colors (<tt>color</tt>, <tt>colorPerVertex</tt>,
  <tt>colorIndex</tt>) for <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> and <tt>IndexedLineSet</tt>
  done.</li>
<li>kambi_vrml_test_suite (major ver++): many new tests to test new
  features (protos, external protos, colors, light scope),
  some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle,
  relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</li>
<li><?php echo a_href_page('Blender VRML stuff page added,
  with improved VRML 2.0 exporter and kanim exporter', 'blender_stuff'); ?>.</li>
<li>Everything is compiled using new FPC 2.2.0.</li>
<li>Numerous memory and speed optimizations to load VRML models and animations
  faster and better, also "The Castle" "loading creatures" is less resource
  consuming now.</li>

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
