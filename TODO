Next WWW update:
- finish X3D:
  - test ComposedShader with X3D XML on some external example,
    to be sure I handle it right.

- update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features, vrml_implementation_status
  (note that it's X3D edition 2, i.e. current spec at 2008-05,
  note that all fields besides MFImage are supported,
  note that all components are known and parsed).
  about X3D.

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.

after all done, remember to fix containerField to all nodes.

test: pure VRML 2.0 should still be output as VRML 2.0, not X3D
(add optional output 1st header line to run_tests.sh for view3dscene)

test kambi_vrml_test_suite
vrml_engine_doc tests
x3d tests
test on white_dune VRMl 97 and X3d output (nurbs incompatible)
parse nist tests
