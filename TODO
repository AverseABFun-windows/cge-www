After next update:
- run init_counters to init blender_stuff counter

next view3dscene update:
<li>Prototypes (both <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt>)
  VRML 2.0 feature is fully implemented now !</li>
<li>For view3dscene, default blending dest factor is
  <tt>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</tt>, since this is expected by most VRML authors.</li>
<li>VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (DirectionalLight affects
  every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking <tt>radius</tt> into account).<li>
<li><tt>ROUTE</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now.
  Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything.
  So at least scenes using routes are partially handled (routes are simply
  ignored), instead of just producing an error.</li>
<li>VRML files compressed by gzip are handled OK even if they have
  normal <tt>.wrl</tt> extension.</li>
<li>--write-to-vrml fixed</li>
<li>Handling of colors (<tt>color</tt>, <tt>colorPerVertex</tt>,
  <tt>colorIndex</tt>) for <tt>IndexedFaceSet</tt> and <tt>IndexedLineSet</tt>
  done.</li>
<li>kambi_vrml_test_suite (major ver++): many new tests to test new
  features (protos, external protos, colors, light scope, running path to test
  NavigationInfo.speed),
  some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle,
  relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</li>
<li><?php echo a_href_page('Blender VRML stuff page added,
  with improved VRML 2.0 exporter and kanim exporter', 'blender_stuff'); ?>.</li>
<li>Everything is compiled using new FPC 2.2.0.</li>
<li>Numerous memory and speed optimizations to load VRML models and animations
  faster and better, also "The Castle" "loading creatures" is less resource
  consuming now.</li>
<li>NavigationInfo.speed is now handled correctly (it sets speed per second)</li>
<li>Engine is ported and works flawlessly on x86-64 on Linux.
  No more only 32-bit :)</li> (TODO: update sources.php and kambi_vrml_game_engine.php
  pages about this. Write in "features" section something like
  "Engine is portable, runs flawlessly on ... (brag about OSes and processors).
  Should be able to compile and run on virtually any modern OS that is
  supported by FPC and has normal OpenGL etc. libraries available."

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
