After next update:
- run init_counters to init blender_stuff counter

next update:
<li>kambi_vrml_test_suite (major ver++): many new tests to test new
  features (protos, external protos, colors, light scope, running path to test
  NavigationInfo.speed),
  some important VRML 1.0 tests ported to VRML 2.0 too (castle,
  relative_names, texture_test, house behind the glass).</li>
<li><?php echo a_href_page('Blender VRML stuff page added,
  with improved VRML 2.0 exporter and kanim exporter', 'blender_stuff'); ?>.</li>
<li>Everything is compiled using new FPC 2.2.0.</li>
<li>Engine is ported and works flawlessly on x86-64 on Linux.
  No more only 32-bit :) Also, it's partially ported to Windows x84-64
  (tested compilation with cross compiler, no actual run tests).
  <p>This also results in the change of archive binary names:
  they all get <tt>i386</tt> after their name, eventually I may release
  precompiled versions for <tt>x86-64</tt> too.</li>
<li>GLWindow allows to change cursor shape.</li>
