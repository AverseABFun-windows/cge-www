Remaining view3dscene 3.4 blockers (bugfix only now):

- loading custom mipmaps on nvidia turns off using mipmaps, for 2D textures (not observed for cube map and 3D, and not observed on 2D with S3TC).
  looks like GL_NEAREST filtering...
  with tex_visualize_mipmaps, both normal from DDS and colored.

- check does "Image.Width < 4) or (Image.Height < 4" in DecompressDDS occurs also on nvidia. If yes, maybe it's my error?
  No problem on nvidia. Hm, although - FPC 2.2.2. Better check with 2.2.4 too.
  What on Mac OS X?

- x86_64 problems with fpc 2.2.4 (copy here reports)
