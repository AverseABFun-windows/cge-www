Text for next update:
- bump mapping
- Wavefront OBJ improved (we handle normal vectors, materials, textures)
- Our blender VRML 97 exporter script improved: set solid/set smooth/autosmooth/autosmooth degrees settings from Blender are correctly exported to VRML file (as creasteAngle field)
After next update:
- regen vrml_engine_doc for html chunked, use.id.as.filename is very important.
  Fix HTML links to vrml_engine_doc to use it.
