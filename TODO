Next WWW update:
- add bump mapping to "the castle", or update kambi_vrml_extensions file
Text for next update:
- bump mapping.
  VRML renderer allows bump mapping, see kambi_vrml_extensions#ext_bump.
  You easily turn this on by Attributes.BumpMapping := true and set Scene.BumpMappingLightPosition however you want, everything else is taken care of automaically.
  Various bump mapping methods are implemented in VRML (auto-detected used best method): dot by multitexturing (not normalized and normalized by cube map), dot by GLSL (optionally with parallax mapping, optionally with steep parallax mapping and self-shadowing).
  view3dscene allows to easily turn on bump mapping, assuming model specifies normal maps.
  castle uses bump mapping, for now only on "fountain" level.
  Programmers: see also bump_mapping demo, with emboss, dot (multitex not normalized and normalized) and all methods built in VRML demos and notes how this is done in bump_mapping/README
- Wavefront OBJ improved (we handle normal vectors, materials, textures)
- Our blender VRML 97 exporter script improved: set solid/set smooth/autosmooth/autosmooth degrees settings from Blender are correctly exported to VRML file (as creasteAngle field)
- I dropped my custom OpenGLh binding in favor of using GL, GLU, GLExt units.
  OpenGLh was developed when FPC had no usable OpenGL binding unit (neither had Delphi)...
  Times have changed, and current GL, GLU, GLExt units are usable, and (thanks to my patches, like
  http://www.mail-archive.com/fpc-devel@lists.freepascal.org/msg02328.html and
  http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7570 and, most of all,
  http://www.freepascal.org/mantis/view.php?id=7600)
  it works good and supports OpenGL 2.0 functions. (while OpenGLh was on GL 1.2 + many extensions level).
- OpenGL shaders support.
  Engine supports easily using ARB vertex / fragment programs (assembly shaders) and GLSL.
  You can also directly specify GLSL shaders inside VRML file, which is a great feature for VRML authors. Syntax of shaders in VRML follows X3D specification.
  link to kambi_vrml_extensions, kambi_vrml_test_suite includes demos of this,
  view3dscene allows to control GLSL shaders and even simply assign GLSL shaders to any file (check out <i>Edit -&gt; Simply assign GLSL shader to all objects</i> menu item)

  Programmers: see also shading_langs_demo/README
- Among many new demo programs, there's also
  kambi_vrml_game_engine/3dmodels.gl/examples/plane_mirror_and_shadow.pasprogram
  to test plane-projected shadows and plane mirrors. Plane-projected shadows
  is only for simple demo (we have shadow volumes, thousand times better
  alhorithm, implemented after all), but plane mirrors will be implemented
  in the future in the VRML engine (using "mirror" Material field automatically).

After next update:
- regen vrml_engine_doc for html chunked, use.id.as.filename is very important.
  Fix HTML links to vrml_engine_doc to use it.
