Remaining view3dscene 3.4 blockers (bugfix only now):

- loading custom mipmaps on nvidia turns off using mipmaps, for 2D textures (not observed for cube map and 3D, and not observed on 2D with S3TC).
  looks like GL_NEAREST filtering...
  with tex_visualize_mipmaps, both normal from DDS and colored.
  Observed with fpc 2.2.2 and 2.2.4, both on kocury/linux/32.

- check does "Image.Width < 4) or (Image.Height < 4" in DecompressDDS occurs also on nvidia. If yes, maybe it's my error?
  No problem on nvidia
  (fpc 2.2.2 kocury/linux/32,
   fpc 2.2.4 kocury/linux/32),
  so possibly only fglrx (or only radeon) problems?
  Check on chantal Mac OS X?
  Check on kocury win?

- fpc 2.2.4 kocury/linux/x86_64 problems:

  opening cubemap_gen_recursive, right after cubemap_gen_in_dynamic_world, once did:

  it's also ultra-slow at loading, just like cubemap_gen_in_dynamic_world.
    It's in Cache.Fonts_IncReference!
    Not reproducible on 32 bit (fpc 2.2.4 kocury/linux/32), so it must be some 64-bit problem.
    Profile.

  also on cubemap_gen_recursive teapots are not perfectly pink at the beginning.
    Reproducible on 32 bit (fpc 2.2.4 kocury/linux/32), so specific to nvidia (or fpc 2.2.4?), not 64bit!

  test the rest on 64bit.
