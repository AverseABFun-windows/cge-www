Text for next update:

wait for freshmeat release accepted. My text:
All X3D multi-texturing, cube map texturing, 3D texturing nodes are implemented. DDS (DirectDraw Surface) image format is fully supported, for all texture types (2D, 3D, cube map). S3TC compression, explicit mipmaps are all supported in DDS files. RenderedTexture node is implemented: a texture rendered from a specified viewpoint. Passing to GLSL shaders various uniform value types and texture nodes is implemented. New extensions to easily make projective texturing and shadow maps. Anisotropic texture filtering is available. Hardware occlusion query is implemented.

*If* I'll ever make public vrml-engine blog on michalis.ii:

- changes_log entry text

<p>Some website improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Since this message, the "latest news" of our engine are hosted using a WordPress blog on <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-blog/">http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/vrmlengine-blog/</a>. All previous URLs will continue to work, and the latest news will always be visible on the main page. You just have more options now, most of all you can comment about the engine updates.</p>
</ul>

- copy the news both to WP and changes_log_common, add this to www/NOTES
- add "comment" links leading to WP comments on blog from the "latest news" item
- add link to "Kambi VRML game engine blog" to michalis.ii main index.php
After next update:
