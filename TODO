After next update:

D.14 Shuttles and pendulums fails with lexer
check more D...

next view3dscene update:
- VRML 2.0 lights are correctly handled (DirectionalLight affects every sibling, positional lights affect whole scene taking radius into account)
- <tt>ROUTE</tt>, <tt>PROTO</tt> and <tt>EXTERNPROTO</tt> constructs of VRML 2.0 are parsed now. Although they still don't actually <b>do</b> anything. So scenes using them produce warnings and are partially handled (features not related to prototypes/routes are handled), instead of just producing error.

next castle update:
- arrows are affected by gravity
- underwater "sick" projection effect, thanks to Grzegorz Hermanowicz (herrmannek) !
- (add herrmannek to castle-credits)
