Next WWW update:
- finish X3D XML support (reread spec, finish all details),
  in particular:
  - add all nodes with fields, with whole X3D abstract hierarchy.
    Fix TNodeX3DGroupingNode to inherit from some TNodeX3D... other node.
    Fix all geometry nodes to inherit from X3DGeometryNode.
    Fix Text node to have solid field (and others? check spec)

    Add to tests auto creation of all registered nodes,
    and check do they have all fields with different names.

  - prototypes,
  - special parsing of Script nodes
    (and shaders --- should I make this somewhat wider feature,
    like
      HasInterfaceDeclarations: idNone, idRestricted, idAll
    public read, protected SetInterfaceDeclarations to use in constructors.
    setting this to idNone frees InterfaceDeclarations, setting to <> idNone
    creates if needed InterfaceDeclarations object.
    This should take care of Script and some shader nodes in one go.

- update all WWW pages, view3dscene.php features, vrml_implementation_status
  about X3D.

Text for next update:

After next update:
- update view3dscene description of freshmeat, to include Collada.
- check does kambi_lines work on Windows in ii 107 now.
