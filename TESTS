There are many automated tests of our engine, useful to run
this (on each platform) before release:

# Basic compilation tests

./test_program_compilation.sh unix|windows
cd kambi_vrml_game_engine/
make clean_container_units container_units # not a test, but useful to run
                                           # and eventually commit
make
make examples

# FPCUnit tests

cd tests/
./compile_console.sh # also "make clean -C .." and then recompile all
                     # in debug mode for compile_console.sh
./test_kambi_units -a

# Test view3dscene VRML/X3D loading/saving/rendering

cd view3dscene/
./run_tests.sh
# (You may also uncomment longer mk_screnshot tests in run_test_once.sh
# and rerun run_tests.sh)

# Recompile kambi_vrml_game_engine and view3dscene and castle Lazarus
# packages, to make sure Lazarus packages work Ok (all required units
# are added etc.).
