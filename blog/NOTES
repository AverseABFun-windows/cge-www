This directory contains Wordpress stuff (theme etc.) to make
a blog of our engine using Wordpress. It's not used after all
--- using our own PHP code for news generation, and linking to standard
SourceForge forums, is simpler/better for now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes for writing news entries:
- all URLs must be absolute (HTML content may be served through RSS feed to various WWW sites)
- no CSS classes, ids should be used --- all style must be contained within the HTML (HTML content may be served through RSS feed to sites that don't have our CSS files loaded)

Unused news message *if* I ever decide to migrate to this Wordpress blog:

<p>Some website improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Since this message, the "latest news" of our engine are hosted using a WordPress blog on <a href="http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/castle-engine-blog/">http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/castle-engine-blog/</a>. All previous URLs will continue to work, and the latest news will always be visible on the main page. You just have more options now, most of all you can comment about the engine updates.</p>
</ul>

- copy the news both to WP and changes_log_common, add this to www/NOTES
- add "comment" links leading to WP comments on blog from the "latest news" item
- add link to "Castle Game Engine blog" to michalis.ii main index.php
After next update:
