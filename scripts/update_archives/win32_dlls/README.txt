This is a collection of Windows DLLs used by various VRML engine
programs, see [http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/].
All Windows binary releases already contains these DLLs
(or only their subset, as e.g. OpenAL and OggVorbis stuff is not
needed by many programs). So normal users should not need to download
this archive, win32_dlls.zip, separately.

These are useful if you use nightly snapshots, svn sources etc.
to get our programs to run.

(Which means that if you read this, you're not normal.
Yeah, and it's already too late, I'm sorry :) )

Sources of these DLLs:
- libpng and zlib: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
- OpenAL: as installed by Creative's OpenAL Windows installer,
  from http://www.openal.org/downloads.html
- OggVorbis things: http://www.vorbis.com/ (don't remember exactly where,
  but I found some archive with precompiled vorbis libs for Windows
  looking from http://www.vorbis.com/)
