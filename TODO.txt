Castle 1/2.0.0 stuff:

- announce:

<p>For now, short plans about the <i>The Castle 2</i>. <!-- teaser </p> --> First of all, the game will actually not be called <i>castle</i> anymore, and will not have in fact anything storyline-related with the original <i>castle</i>. It will be just developed using the same engine, starting with exactly the same source code. But all 3D data, storyline (let\'s pretend for the sake of discussion that <i>castle 1.0.0</i> had some storyline), and even the title will be completely separate.</p>

<p>So far I have ideas for two nice storylines for <i>Castle 2</i>. I really don\'t know yet which one I\'ll pick:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>One idea is called <i>&quot;Human Programming&quot;</i>. This would be a nice short 3D game, with a "survival" feeling (but no, no zombies, thank you very much). It would be essentially one large level to design, plus two special small sceneries.</p></li>

  <li><p>The other idea is for now called <i>&quot;The Three Servants&quot;</i> (no, I will not tell you why, discovering the meaning of the title is part of the game actually :) ). This one would be much larger game, with a couple of large levels (I hope to plug some of them with procedurally generated stuff).</p></li>
</ol>


- announce:

  Continuing engine 2.0.0 work, the "castle" source code was just ported to use SceneManager features. This means that previous TLevelObject hierarchy is now a T3D hierarchy (actually, TLevelObject was one of the inspirations for T3D tree; but it didn't handle VRML/X3D events well, unlike our new T3D). This also means that castle's levels (both base level 3D files, and level helper 3D files (for buttons etc.)) can now use fully possibilities of VRML/X3D events.

  To celebrate that,

  1. I added many new animated eye-candy to the "The Fountain" level (one of the "demo" levels, unlocked from the beginning for anyone). There's some animated water with reflections + refractions by shaders (actually taken from a similar demo_models demo), there's KambiScript usage (this fountain droplets, aka "poor man's particle engine"), there's some demo of VRML/X3D events providing interactive behavior of the level (TODO) etc. Enjoy!

     (For people with poor GPUs, a short video showing walking around the level is here TODO. But of course I encourage you to actually play the game, as it feels even better when you're inside the game. You can get the game from SVN, or wait for the next release.)

  2. To emphasize that this closes most important castle's technical lack, and to emphasize that "castle", as the game, is considered "finished" now (only imoprtant bugfixes from now), next castle release will be marked by 1.0.0.

     No fanfares, please, as 1.0.0 will have the same basic gameplay as last 0.8.3. It's rather to emphasize that we're working on castle 2.0.0 now :)
