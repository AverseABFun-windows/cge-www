htodcs/ is exactly what goes into http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/

screenshots/ are only a copy (sometimes with better resolution)
of the same screenshots that are available on SF screenshot
page of our project.

scripts/ various scripts, usually in Bash, helpful to manage the
website. Scripts inside scripts/shell.sf.net are meant to be
run when logged on shell.sourceforge.net server, i.e. these scripts
are supposed to work on currently "online" version on the website on SF.
Other scripts are meant to be run on your local version, checkout
out somewhere on your local computer.

----------------------------------------
Procedure to update WWW content:
("locally" means that this is done on a local copy of the repository
www/ directory, preferably *not* on "online" copy on shell.sf.net):

- good practice after large changes is to check for dead links
  by linkchecker.sh

- if it's important change, you may wish to update last_update.php
  and changes_log.php pages.

- if you change some content managed inside SVN:
  - commit your changes, of course
  - svn update on SF within htdocs/

- if you change some content outside SVN:
  (These are some things that are automatically generated and it would
  be a waste to keep them inside SVN repository... so they have to
  be copied in a normal way.) :
  - upload on SF within htdocs/ all that's needed
  - run mk_sums_md5.sh locally. This calculates md5 sums on your local
    files.
  - on SF shell server, run check_sums_md5.sh. This will check md5 sums
    uploaded in previous step, thus checking that all files (even those
    ignored by SVN) were uploaded correctly.
