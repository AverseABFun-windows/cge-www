htodcs/ is exactly what goes into http://vrmlengine.sourceforge.net/

screenshots/ are only a copy (sometimes with better resolution)
of the same screenshots that are available on SF screenshot
page of our project.

scripts/ are various scripts, usually in bash, helpful to manage the
website. Scripts inside scripts/shell.sf.net are meant to be
run when logged on shell.sourceforge.net server, i.e. these scripts
are supposed to work on currently "online" version on the website on SF.
Other scripts are meant to be run on your local version, checkouted
somewhere on your local computer.

----------------------------------------
Procedure to update WWW content:
("locally" means that this is done on a local copy of the repository
www/ directory, preferably *not* on "online" copy on shell.sf.net):

- When release is packed, it's nice to tag it in SVN:

  svn copy https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/trunk/XXX \
	   https://vrmlengine.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vrmlengine/tags/XXX/VERSION \
    -m "Tagging the VERSION version of 'XXX'."

- Release on SourceForge.

  New FRS (http://p.sf.net/sourceforge/FRS):
  - Upload to
    ssh://kambi,vrmlengine@frs.sourceforge.net/home/frs/project/v/vr/vrmlengine/
    Follow dirnames as default: program_name/version_number/.
  - Only for view3dscene: In file explorer
    https://sourceforge.net/project/admin/explorer.php?group_id=200653
    mark platforms for new files. This is only for platform (default guessed
    looking at OS) links, so it's done only for view3dscene as our "default"
    package".

  After release, download and compare are the files the same.

- if you modified kambi_vrml_game_engine, you may want to update apidoc/

  Also update $engine_ver in htdocs/kambi_vrml_game_engine.php, to reflect
  with what engine ver each sources were tested.

- good practice after large changes is to check
  linkchecker.sh and validate_html.sh

- if it's important change, you may wish to add entry to news_common.php

- if you change some content managed inside SVN:
  - commit your changes, of course
  - svn update on SF within htdocs/

- if you change some content outside SVN:
  (These are some things that are automatically generated and it would
  be a waste to keep them inside SVN repository... so they have to
  be copied in a normal way.) :
  - upload on SF within htdocs/ all that's needed
  - make sure that "other" users don't have uncessesary permissions
    (files created by svn inside .svn and files updated by SVN
    should get OK permissions from start, but "content outside SVN"
    may have too permissive permissions after uploading e.g. if I upload
    by nautilus): run secure_permissions.sh on SF
  - run mk_sums_md5.sh locally. This calculates md5 sums on your local
    files.
  - on SF shell server, run check_sums_md5.sh. This will check md5 sums
    uploaded in previous step, thus checking that all files (even those
    ignored by SVN) were uploaded correctly.

- if you want to create some new counters, make sure to update
  script init_counters.sh and then run it on SF

- after important release, I may wish to announce it:
  - sf news for vrmlengine project
  - engine source code release means updating FPC contrib units info
    (see fpc_contrib_units_data.txt,
    http://www.freepascal.org/contrib/db.php3?category=Graphics).
  - new release of view3dscene and/or castle go to freshmeat:
    http://freshmeat.net/projects/view3dscene/
    http://freshmeat.net/projects/castlegame/
  - pascalgamedevelopment may be informed about especially important
    releases
  - really large new features may cause updates of project description:

  - Maybe: http://www.web3d.org/news/submit/
    ... but it's pretty much ignored, giving up on this.
    As well as submitting to web3d.org list of progs.

  - Some day:
    announce on game engines list http://www.devmaster.net/engines/
