We use custom Piwik installation.
Reason: SF Hosted App Piwik is broken (and outdated), see
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/17978
http://forum.piwik.org/read.php?2,72610

I upgrade it by hand (because on SF, one shares hosting with
many projects, so security must be good, so you don't
want to set permissions to make everything writeable by apache).
Following http://piwik.org/docs/update/ . Cheatsheet:

cd_ce
cd htdocs/
wget http://piwik.org/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
# This is a little hack, I should better delete old piwik/ and create new piwik/,
# presercing only my config/config.ini.php
rm latest.zip How\ to\ install\ Piwik.html
chown -R kambi:apache piwik/
# See bottom of http://piwik.org/docs/installation/: only tmp/ needs to be writeable by Apache
chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o= piwik/
chmod -R g+w           piwik/tmp/
