Layout:

htodcs/ is exactly what goes into http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/

screenshots/ are only a copy (sometimes with better resolution)
of the same screenshots that are available on SF screenshot
page of our project.

scripts/ are various scripts, usually in bash, helpful to manage the
website.

  scripts/shell.sf.net are meant to be
  run when logged on shell.sourceforge.net server, i.e. these scripts
  are supposed to work on currently "online" version on the website on SF.

  Rest of scripts/ should usually be run on your local version,
  checkouted somewhere on your local computer. Running them on shell.sf.net
  is not preferred, sometimes has little sense.

----------------------------------------
Procedure to update WWW content:

- Making a release:
  1. testing is described in TESTS.txt
  2. compiling and packing releases is described in pack/README.txt

- When release is packed, it's nice to tag it in SVN.
  See scripts/make_svn_tags.sh --- leave uncommented only
  the lines for newly released programs, and run it.

- Release on SourceForge.

  New FRS (http://p.sf.net/sourceforge/FRS):
  - Upload to
    sftp://kambi,castle-engine@frs.sourceforge.net/home/frs/project/c/ca/castle-engine
    Follow dirnames as default: program_name/version_number/.
  - Only for view3dscene: On https://sourceforge.net/projects/castle-engine/files/
    mark new view3dscene released files as default downloads for given OS.
    This is only for default download on given OS, we suggest here
    view3dscene as our "default package".

  After release, download and compare are the files the same.

- if you modified castle_game_engine, you may want to update apidoc/

  Also update $engine_ver in htdocs/engine.php, to reflect
  with what engine ver each sources were tested.

- good practice after large changes is to check
  linkchecker.sh and validate_html.sh

- if it's important change, you may wish to add entry to news_common.php

- if you change some content managed inside SVN:
  - commit your changes, of course
  - svn update on SF within htdocs/

- if may be good to fix old links leading to
  http://michalis.ii.uni.wroc.pl/castle-engine-snapshots/docs/ now
  to go to http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/ .
  (M-x kam-castle-engine-snapshot-docs-to-normal in Michalis Emacs.)

- if you change some content outside SVN:
  (These are some things that are automatically generated and it would
  be a waste to keep them inside SVN repository... so they have to
  be copied in a normal way.) :
  - reference and vrml_engine_doc can be automatically uploaded by "make upload"
    in appropriate dir
  - upload on SF within htdocs/ all that's needed
  - make sure that "other" users don't have uncessesary permissions
    (files created by svn inside .svn and files updated by SVN
    should get OK permissions from start, but "content outside SVN"
    may have too permissive permissions after uploading e.g. if I upload
    by nautilus): run secure_permissions.sh on SF
  - run mk_sums_md5.sh locally. This calculates md5 sums on your local
    files.
  - on SF shell server, run check_sums_md5.sh. This will check md5 sums
    uploaded in previous step, thus checking that all files (even those
    ignored by SVN) were uploaded correctly.

- after important release, I may wish to announce it:

  - engine source code release means updating FPC contrib units info
    (see fpc_contrib_units_data.txt,
    http://www.freepascal.org/contrib/contribs.html).
  - new release of view3dscene and/or castle go to freshmeat:
    http://freecode.com/projects/view3dscene/
    http://freecode.com/projects/castlegame/
  - http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/
    go to the 'Home' section of the site and create 'News' article
    Make sure that when you are creating a new News "article" you are in the News section of the front page. If you are in the Articles section, it'll create an "article" instead.
    (instructions on http://www.pascalgamedevelopment.com/showthread.php?6406-Posting-News-on-the-front-page-not-the-Forums ).
  - x3d-public mailing list
  - if new VRML extensions: remember to post to Joerg about them
  - http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/
    Examples on:
    http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,15653.0.html
  - Post new topic on our forum, to encourage some discussion.
  - Post on facebook, google+, twitter.

  - really large new features may cause updates of project description.
    Change project_description.txt text, and see there for a list of places
    where it's used.

    Also Lazarus wiki contains longer description of our project:
      http://wiki.freepascal.org/Castle_Game_Engine
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Components_and_Code_examples#Packages_for_FPC.2FLazarus_.28not_hosted_here.29
      http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Projects_using_Lazarus#Castle_Game_Engine

  - Maybe:
    - http://www.web3d.org/news/submit/
      ... but it's pretty much ignored, giving up on this.
      As well as submitting to web3d.org list of progs.
    - Some day:
      announce on game engines list http://www.devmaster.net/engines/
