Title:
Snapshot (unstable) release of Castle Game Engine

Description:
This is a "snapshot" release, automatically updated after every Castle Game Engine commit (if it passes some automatic tests). In practice, it is very stable, and [some people](https://cat-astrophe-games.com/) even use it in "production" to develop games.

This snapshot release contains all the latest cool stuff described on [Castle Game Engine News](https://castle-engine.io/wp/).
