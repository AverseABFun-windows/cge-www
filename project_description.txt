  Summary: 3D game engine focused on X3D and beautiful graphic effects.
  Description: Game engine focused on X3D. Rendering and processing of 3D models in X3D, VRML, Collada and other formats. Latest graphic effects including shadows, shaders, mirrors. Animation, collision detection, 3D sound. Also home of view3dscene - our full-featured VRML/X3D browser. And also home of various games developed using the engine, like "The Castle".
  Features:
    Many 3D formats supported: X3D, VRML, Collada, MD3, 3DS, more
    Reading and writing of X3D, converting other 3D models to X3D
    Modern OpenGL renderer using shaders and VBOs
    Shadows using shadow maps and shadow volumes
    Mirrors using cube environment mapping and other methods
    Scene manager, custom viewports
    Bump mapping, with steep parallax bump mapping with self-shadowing
    Screen-space effects in GLSL
    3D sound using OpenAL
    Portable (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD...)
    Source code in clean ObjectPascal (for FreePascal)
    Includes Lazarus components for RAD development

  (same thing as https://fundry.com/project/91-kambi-vrml-game-engine)

An open-source 3D game engine with an excellent support for VRML / X3D and many advanced graphic effects. Written in clean Object Pascal. The engine is the basis for our view3dscene (VRML / X3D browser), and "The Castle" (FPS game). Previously known as "Kambi VRML game engine".
