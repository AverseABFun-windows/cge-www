(This is obsolete info for creating counters for
htdocs/kambi-php-lib/counter.php . I don't use them anymore,
piwik gives me all that I need and more.)

How counters dir was created:

cd /tmp/persistent
mkdir vrmlengine
cd vrmlengine
mkdir counters
chgrp vrmlengine counters
chmod g+x counters
chmod g+w counters

Result: l shows now
drwxrwxr-x  2 kambi vrmlengine 4096 Jul 24 22:25 counters/

Note that without "chmod o+w counters" other people
cannot add new files or delete files from this directory
(either using WWW scripts, that run as nobody, or from SF shell).
Although they can freely modify or empty the files contents,
hopefully this will secure me at least against some stupid attackers
that try to "cd" some dirs inside /tmp/persistent/ and execute rm -Rf *.
I cannot get real security on /tmp/persistent/ on SF, so I take what I can.

This also means that all counter files will have to be created first,
from shell server. init_counters.sh may be used to create counters
from scratch, counters for pages previously existing on
http://camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/ were moved to SF.

Counters should have permissions 666 (read-write by all).
There's no escape from this, Apache must be able to read-write them.

If you want to create some new counters, make sure to update
script init_counters.sh and then run it on SF.
